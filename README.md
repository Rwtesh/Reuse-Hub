# Reuse-Hub
Our project’s aim is to develop a campus-only online marketplace and resource sharing platform which simplifies student life by connecting seniors and freshers within college. 
The motivation arises from the recurring problem faced by new students which is access to affordable study materials, books, and hostel essentials while many seniors basically end up throwing away a lot of resources.

Existing solutions such as OLX, Amazon, or informal WhatsApp groups are either too general or unorganized for campus-only exchanges.
The project’s aim is to create a secure, user-friendly website that enables students to share, donate, or sell their study materials and personal items exclusively between college students.

The system will consist of two primary modules: a Notes Sharing section, where seniors can upload study materials organized by subject and semester, and a Marketplace module for listing reusable items like books/lab equipment for sale. A simple messaging interface will ensure safe and direct communication between buyers and sellers.

Technically, the platform will be developed using Python (FastAPI and MongoDB) for the backend, SQLite for database management, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend. As for authentication only verified student IDs will be able to log in, ensuring a trustworthy environment. The system will undergo tests before deployment on a local or cloud server such as PythonAnywhere or Heroku.
The final product will give rise to an affordable collaboration among students by allowing the reuse of resources and easy access to academic supplies. Beyond reducing costs, the project encourages community building, knowledge sharing, and environmental responsibility leading to better student-exchange resources within their campus ecosystem.
