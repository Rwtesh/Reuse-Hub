# Reuse-Hub
ReuseHub is a campus-exclusive platform designed to help students share, buy, sell, or donate notes and reusable items within their college community. The system solves the common challenge faced by freshers in finding affordable academic resources while reducing waste created when seniors discard useful materials. Built using FastAPI and MongoDB, the platform features secure authentication with college emails, a notes-sharing module, a student marketplace, and an integrated chat system for safe buyer-seller communication. With a clean HTML/CSS/Bootstrap frontend and efficient backend routing, ReuseHub promotes sustainability, cost-efficiency, and collaboration across the campus.
